## UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To perform a Heuristic Evaluation of the Amazon app/website and compare its UX with a competitor (Flipkart), then redesign and evaluate improvements for better usability.

## Algorithm:

Select and compare 2 competitor e-commerce apps/websites: Amazon and Flipkart.

Perform a heuristic evaluation using Nielsen’s 10 usability principles.

Analyze and document UX issues in both interfaces.

Propose improvements and develop a redesigned version of Amazon’s homepage/product flow.

Compare usability between original and redesigned layouts.

## Procedure

1. Open the existing Amazon app

Examine the homepage, search bar placement, category navigation, cart visibility, and product listing layout.

2. Identify a key user task

Task selected: “Add a product to the cart and proceed to checkout.”
Note how many steps the user needs in Amazon vs Flipkart.

3. Document the current UX flow in Amazon

Common steps:
Home → Search → Product listing → Product Page → Add to Cart → Checkout

Pain points:

Cluttered homepage with many banners

Too many sections before reaching essentials

Recommended items push product search downward

4. Create a redesigned prototype

Redesign changes applied:

Clean minimal homepage

Smart Categories at top

Larger search bar (“Search Amazon faster”)

Quick Cart and Orders buttons

Reduced banner size

Clear “Continue Shopping / Buy Now” shortcuts

5. Conduct user test

Ask users to perform the same task in:

Original Amazon layout

Redesigned Amazon layout

Record:

Time taken

Number of taps

Visibility of cart/checkout

User satisfaction

Errors/confusion moments

6. Compare results

Analyze whether the redesigned flow improves:

Visibility

Navigation speed

Information clarity

User control

Document all findings.
